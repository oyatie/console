// One Rust version, one file, enforced.
//
// Before 2026-09-10 the version lived as a literal in 13 workflow steps, in a
// foundation gate, and in `backend/rust-toolchain.toml` -- which, being nested,
// did not govern the root-cwd invocations CI actually uses. Buck2's
// `system_rust_toolchain` took a fourteenth version: whatever the runner image
// shipped. Four different compilers, one of which was nondeterministic.
//
// The literals are gone. This gate is what stops the next one, because a
// convention nothing checks is a convention that lasts until the next hurry.
//
// Scope, stated so it is not mistaken for more than it is.
//
// COVERED: everything under `.github` -- YAML, shell inside `run:` blocks, and
// the `.mjs`/`.js` files that live there. The shapes below were derived from an
// adversarial sweep in which SEVEN crafted-but-plausible inputs walked straight
// past an earlier revision: env-var indirection into `rustup default`,
// `uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.99.0`, a bare `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN:`,
// `rustup-init --default-toolchain`, `rustup component add --toolchain`,
// `rustup install`, and a one-comment bypass of the whole gate via the reindeer
// carve-out. Each of those is now a shape or a narrowed exemption. Any change
// here should be re-run against those cases before it is believed.
//
// NOT COVERED, and deliberately so: anything outside `.github`. Two live
// instances, both real second sources of truth --
//   * `backend/Dockerfile` pins its own `rust:` image, and also COPYs a
//     `backend/rust-toolchain.toml` that no longer exists.
//   * a toolchain file under `third-party/` is excluded on purpose, because
//     vendored crates legitimately carry their own.
// Widening the scan is cheap; claiming a coverage it does not have is not, and
// this gate has already once been described as covering more than it did.
