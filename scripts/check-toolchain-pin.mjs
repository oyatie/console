// One Rust version, one file, enforced.
//
// Before 2026-09-10 the version lived as a literal in 13 workflow steps, in a
// foundation gate, and in `backend/rust-toolchain.toml` -- which, being nested,
// did not govern the root-cwd invocations CI actually uses. Buck2's
// `system_rust_toolchain` took a fourteenth version: whatever the runner image
// shipped. Four different compilers, one of which was nondeterministic.
//
// The literals are gone. This gate is what stops the next one, because a
// convention nothing checks is a convention that lasts until the next hurry.
//
// Scope, stated so it is not mistaken for more than it is: this scans `.github`
// for YAML and shell shapes. A version in a Dockerfile, a Python script, or a
// path outside `.github` is NOT caught, and a toolchain file under
// `third-party/` is deliberately excluded because vendored crates carry their
// own. Widening the scan is cheap; claiming a coverage it does not have is not.
