 * passing locally only because this machine happens to have it.

 * the subprocess probe ran BEFORE the local source check and a developer with
 * an untracked file was told to install wasm-bindgen. The gate now validates
 * the listing first, which is both the more actionable error and the reason
 * the three FAILURE cases below need no stub at all -- verified by running
 * them with wasm-bindgen removed from PATH.
 *
 * The shim survives for the one case that expects `--write` to SUCCEED, which
 * cannot complete without the tool. It stays a real binary on PATH rather than
 * a monkeypatch, so `cliBindgen()` is exercised unstubbed.
