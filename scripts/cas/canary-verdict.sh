# Decide what an empty CAS restore MEANS. Three situations reach that point and
# they are not the same thing:
#
#   (a) a seed exists under this prefix and the restore failed  -> broken, fail
#   (b) no seed under this prefix, other compilers have seeds   -> new compiler, pass
#   (c) no nativelink seeds at all                              -> first run, pass
#
# The job used to green all three. (b) happens on EVERY toolchain roll, because
# the cache prefix carries the compiler (#1086) and dev has not seeded the new
# one yet -- so the run right after a compiler change, the one you would most
# want a real cache assertion from, was the one guaranteed to assert nothing and
# report success (#1089).
#
# Lives here rather than inline in the workflow so the branches can be tested.
# (a) and (c) essentially never occur naturally, so CI alone would never
# exercise them.
#
#   canary-verdict.sh --prefix P --log FILE [--restored KEY] [--keys FILE]
#
# Omitting --keys means the cache list could not be read, which is its own
# outcome: it cannot tell (a) from (b) or (c), and says so instead of implying
# a cache assertion it did not make.
