// The committed hydration bundle must be the one this source produces.
//
// `backend/crates/payroll/ui/pkg/` holds a wasm binary and its JS glue that
// SHIP: `src/lib.rs` include_bytes! them into the server binary and serves them
// at /_ui/pkg. They are produced by tools/ui/build-payroll-wasm.sh, by hand.
// Nothing regenerated or checked them, so the committed bytes could drift from
// the source that is supposed to produce them -- and had. Rebuilding under the
// pin this gate was added on moved the wasm from 373,332 to 383,081 bytes
// (#1092). An earlier revision of this comment said "640 bytes stale", a
// pre-bump figure that cannot be re-derived from this tree and that
// contradicted its own commit message; replaced with the number anyone here
// can reproduce.
//
// `backend/app/tests/health_readiness.rs` asserts the served bytes, which looks
// like it would catch this and cannot: it pins the COMMITTED bytes, not the
// bytes the source produces, so it passes with equal enthusiasm either way.
//
// What this checks, offline:
//   * every input's content, so editing the crate without rebundling fails
//   * the input SET, so adding or deleting a source file fails even if every
//     surviving file is untouched
//   * every output's content, so hand-editing the artifact fails
//   * the toolchain channel, and the wasm-bindgen CLI that actually emitted the
//     glue, because both change the bytes
//
// Only GIT-TRACKED files under src/ are inputs, which would leave an untracked
// or gitignored source compiled by cargo and invisible here on both sides. That
// is not left as a residual: --write refuses outright when git reports anything
// under src/ it is not listing (see sourceFiles), so the blind manifest cannot
// be written in the first place.
//
// What it does NOT check, stated so it is not mistaken for more:
//   * anything reached through dependency resolution: Cargo.lock, and the
//     `[workspace.dependencies]` this crate inherits `serde` from. Widening to
//     either would fire on every unrelated backend bump, and the failure this
//     gate exists for is "edited the crate, forgot to rebundle". The existing
//     assertions in src/lib.rs are the tripwire for that case -- they bind the
//     SSR-emitted island name to both committed artifacts, so a dependency
//     change that moved the island hash fails there.
