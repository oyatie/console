# Operations

This directory contains the Docker Compose production stack for the MNT FSM backend.

## Local Verification

Boot the production stack:

```sh
docker compose -f ops/compose.yml up -d
```

Check the public Traefik HTTPS route:

```sh
curl -k https://mnt.localhost/healthz
curl -k https://mnt.localhost/readyz
```

For direct service access during development, add the override:

```sh
docker compose -f ops/compose.yml -f ops/compose.dev.yml up -d
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
```

For the host-launched full-stack developer loop, prefer the npm wrapper:

```sh
npm run dev:up
```

`scripts/dev-up.mjs` layers `ops/compose.dev-deps.yml` on top of
`ops/compose.yml` and `ops/compose.dev.yml`, using the `mnt-dev` Compose project
by default. That dev-only overlay adds Mailpit, a published OTEL port, and the
Postgres WAL archive retention helper described below.

Shut the stack down:

```sh
docker compose -f ops/compose.yml down
```

## Dev Postgres WAL Archive Retention

Issue #366 is guarded by a dev-only WAL archive pruner so repeated
`npm run dev:up` / `npm run dev:down` cycles do not leave an unbounded local WAL
archive volume.

- Where archives live: `ops/compose.yml` still archives Postgres WAL into the
  project-scoped `postgres-wal-archive` volume. In the normal dev wrapper this is
  Docker volume `mnt-dev_postgres-wal-archive`, mounted at
  `/var/lib/postgresql/wal-archive` in Postgres and `/wal-archive` in the pruner.
- Retention limit: the default policy deletes matching WAL/timeline/backup
  history archive files older than 72 hours and also caps retained archive bytes
  at 1 GiB, while always preserving at least the newest 8 archive files for local
  PITR/debug safety.
- Enforcement: `postgres-wal-archive-pruner` is defined only in
  `ops/compose.dev-deps.yml` and is included by `scripts/dev-up.mjs` for
  `dev:up` and `dev:bootstrap`. It runs outside Postgres `archive_command`, waits
  for the dev Postgres container to become healthy, prunes once every 300
  seconds, and logs as `dev-wal-pruner`. A pruner failure must not make Postgres
  WAL archiving fail.
- Overrides: `MNT_DEV_WAL_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_HOURS`,
  `MNT_DEV_WAL_ARCHIVE_MAX_BYTES`, `MNT_DEV_WAL_ARCHIVE_MIN_SEGMENTS`, and
  `MNT_DEV_WAL_ARCHIVE_PRUNE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` tune the dev policy. Set the age
  or size bound to `0`/`off` only for a temporary local PITR drill that needs
  extra WAL history.

Inspect current local dev WAL archive usage without relying on host-specific
Docker volume mount paths:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v mnt-dev_postgres-wal-archive:/wal-archive:ro \
  postgres:18.4@sha256:65f70a152846cf504dff86e807007e9aeac98c3aeb7b62541b2c55ab9d264e56 \
  bash -ceu 'du -sh /wal-archive; find /wal-archive -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l'
```

If local WAL archive storage is already large, first run a one-shot prune through
the same service contract:

```sh
docker compose -p mnt-dev \
  -f ops/compose.yml -f ops/compose.dev.yml -f ops/compose.dev-deps.yml \
  run --rm -e MNT_DEV_WAL_ARCHIVE_PRUNE_ONCE=1 postgres-wal-archive-pruner --once
```

For an urgent local cleanup where no local PITR/debug archive needs to be kept,
stop the dev stack and remove only the dev WAL archive volume:

```sh
npm run dev:down
docker volume rm mnt-dev_postgres-wal-archive
```

The next `npm run dev:up` recreates the archive volume and starts the pruner with
the bounded policy. Do not apply this cleanup to production-like Compose projects
or production DR storage; `ops/compose.yml`, `ops/backup/`, and `ops/dr/` remain
responsible for continuous WAL archiving and off-VM retention.

## Image Pins

- Postgres is pinned to `postgres:18.4@sha256:65f70a152846cf504dff86e807007e9aeac98c3aeb7b62541b2c55ab9d264e56`.
- Traefik v3 was live-verified as `traefik:v3.7.5`.
- SeaweedFS is pinned to `chrislusf/seaweedfs:4.32`, one release behind the live `4.33` line per ADR-0005.
- OpenTelemetry Collector contrib is pinned to `0.154.0`.

Refresh a digest before an architecture change:

```sh
docker manifest inspect postgres:18.4
```

## OCI Deployment Steps

1. Provision an OCI Compute VM with Docker Engine and the Compose plugin installed.
2. Create DNS records for the production host and point them at the VM public IP.
3. Set production environment variables in the VM shell or a root-readable env file:

```sh
export MNT_APP_HOST=api.example.com
export MNT_POSTGRES_DB=mnt_prod
export MNT_POSTGRES_USER=mnt_app
export MNT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD='<stored in the production secret manager>'
```

4. Copy the repository checkout to the VM, then build and boot:

```sh
docker compose -f ops/compose.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f ops/compose.yml ps
curl -k "https://${MNT_APP_HOST}/readyz"
```

5. Configure OCI firewall/security-list ingress for `80/tcp` and `443/tcp` only. Do not expose Postgres, SeaweedFS master/filer/admin ports, or the app container directly.
6. Configure backups and PITR under the T0.9/T0.13 runbooks before production data enters the system.

Actual OCI provisioning is an operator action; this repository only declares the deployable stack.
