/**
 * AUTH-09 — local dev-auth role switcher.
 *
 * Proves the W3 replacement for the deleted dev-preview fixture mode end to
 * end: the switcher on /login mints a role/org session against the REAL
 * backend (built with `--features dev-auth`, the default for the host
 * `bacon` job — see backend/bacon.toml), and a page that used to fall back to
 * hardcoded fixture rows on a failed/absent API response (Leave Management)
 * now has no such branch at all — it must render the real (here: empty,
 * since a fresh dev-auth persona has no HR records) API result instead.
 *
 * Runs against `node scripts/dev-up.mjs up` (backend + web on the host, real
 * Postgres in the deps containers) — NOT the WebAuthn cold-start e2e harness,
 * which dev-auth deliberately bypasses.
