# Mobile Release Secrets

T1.11 adds a tag-gated mobile release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
It uses fastlane `2.236.1`, verified live from RubyGems on 2026-06-12, because the current fastlane docs support App Store Connect API-key auth for TestFlight and Play service-account JSON auth for `supply`.

Uploads are intentionally not faked. On a `v*` tag, the workflow fails before upload with an explicit missing-secret message until the values below are added by the user.

Release gating is intentionally split:

- PR/main CI keeps path filters for fast feedback, but OpenAPI contract and
  generated Swift-client changes are included in both the main CI and iOS UI
  gates because the iOS app depends on `clients/swift`.
- GitHub Actions does not evaluate `paths` for tag pushes, so `v*` tags run the
  full CI workflow and the iOS UI workflow regardless of changed files.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` waits for the same SHA's CI and iOS UI test
  workflows before any Play/TestFlight upload step starts. Dry-run dispatches
  skip that upstream wait so local build checks remain cheap.
- `.github/workflows/image-release.yml` separately waits for the same SHA's CI
  workflow before building, scanning, signing, and publishing images.

## GitHub Secrets

Add these in GitHub repository settings as Actions secrets.

### Release Please

The `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` workflow opens/updates release PRs on
pushes to `main`.

- Repository Actions setting: keep **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve
  pull requests** enabled. The workflow-level `contents: write` and
  `pull-requests: write` permissions are not enough when that repo setting is
  disabled.
- Optional `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`: fine-grained PAT used instead of
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` when automatic downstream tag workflows should chain after
  release-please creates a tag. Grant repository permissions:
  - Contents: Read and write
  - Pull requests: Read and write

Without `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`, release PR/tag creation can still work through
`GITHUB_TOKEN` after the repo setting above is enabled, but tag-triggered image
and mobile release workflows must be triggered manually because GitHub suppresses
recursive workflow triggers from `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Android / Play Internal Track

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: base64 of the production Android upload keystore (`.jks` or `.keystore`). Obtain or create this as the Play upload key; keep the original outside the repo.
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: keystore password.
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: upload key alias inside the keystore.
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`: upload key password.
- `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: full JSON key for a Google Play Console service account with access to this app and permission to upload to the internal track. Create it from Play Console API access / Google Cloud service account setup.

Optional:

- `ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME`: package override. Defaults to `com.maintenance.field`.

### iOS / TestFlight

- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`: App Store Connect API key ID.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`: App Store Connect issuer ID.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_BASE64`: base64 of the downloaded App Store Connect `.p8` API key. Apple only allows downloading the key file once.
- `IOS_APP_IDENTIFIER`: bundle identifier registered in App Store Connect. The
  repo default is `com.maintenance.field` (`ios/Config/App.xcconfig` defaults
  `MNT_IOS_BUNDLE_ID` to the same value under Team `98Q89GFZWP`), but this is
  production-ready only after the App ID and capabilities are registered and
  matched by provisioning profiles.
- `IOS_SCHEME`: Xcode scheme to archive, for example `MaintenanceFieldApp` once
  the archive-capable project/workspace is available to the release job.
- `IOS_XCODE_PROJECT`: path to an archive-capable Xcode project that exists in
  the checkout, for example `ios/MaintenanceField.xcodeproj` only after that
  project has been generated/committed or otherwise materialized for release.
- `IOS_XCODE_WORKSPACE`: path to the Xcode workspace if the app uses one. Set
  this instead of `IOS_XCODE_PROJECT`; the path must exist in the checkout before
  fastlane runs.
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`: base64 of the Apple Distribution certificate exported as `.p12`.
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: password for the `.p12`.
- `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`: base64 of the App Store distribution provisioning profile.
- `IOS_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`: temporary CI keychain password.

Current iOS repo state has three separate readiness levels:

1. **SwiftPM build/test:** `ios/` builds through Swift Package Manager. The
   release dry-run lane and main CI build this path without uploading to
   TestFlight.
2. **XcodeGen/XCUITest:** `.github/workflows/ios-ui-tests.yml` generates
   `ios/MaintenanceField.xcodeproj` from `ios/project.yml` with XcodeGen and runs
   Simulator XCUITest/accessibility checks. That generated `.xcodeproj` is a CI
   artifact and is not committed.
3. **TestFlight/archive:** the release workflow has an iOS/TestFlight lane, but
   it requires App Store Connect credentials, manual signing assets,
   `IOS_APP_IDENTIFIER`, `IOS_SCHEME`, and either `IOS_XCODE_PROJECT` or
   `IOS_XCODE_WORKSPACE` pointing at an archive-capable path that exists in the
   release checkout. Until those inputs and a signed archive/export have been
   proven, TestFlight and production go-live are blocked.

The workflow derives `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_NAME` from the uploaded provisioning profile and passes it to fastlane export options. If you run the `ios release` lane locally, set `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_NAME` to that profile's `Name` value.

## Local Dry Runs

Install the pinned fastlane bundle:

```sh
bundle install
```

Use Ruby 3.4 or newer locally. The macOS system Ruby is not sufficient for the current pinned fastlane version.

Run dry-run lanes without upload secrets:

```sh
bundle exec fastlane android dry_run
bundle exec fastlane ios dry_run
```

Android release builds remain unsigned unless all four `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` environment variables are present. This allows local unsigned release AAB/APK assembly without production signing material.

## Release Tags

Push a tag matching `v*` only after all required secrets are present and the
release commit has passed CI + iOS UI gates:

```sh
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

When all required secrets and archive inputs are present, the mobile release
workflow waits for CI and iOS UI tests on the same SHA, then uploads:

- Android `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` to the Play internal track.
- iOS archive output from the configured Xcode project/workspace to TestFlight.

A passing SwiftPM build, release dry run, or XcodeGen XCUITest run is not itself
TestFlight or production readiness; it is only the corresponding build/test state
above.
