# Non-OCI Talos mail and iMessage relay runbook

## Deployment split

The current OCI Talos cluster keeps the existing production app, web, API, worker,
database, object-storage integration, and transactional email path. OTP and admin
one-time email must continue to use OCI Email Delivery from the existing
`mnt-config` values:

- `MNT_EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.email.ap-chuncheon-1.oci.oraclecloud.com`
- `MNT_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587`
- `MNT_EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@knllogistic.com`

Do not reclassify this OCI SMTP relay as authoritative corporate mailbox or MX
hosting. It is only the outbound transactional path for current product flows.

The non-OCI Talos cluster is the intended home for new authoritative corporate
mail/MX workloads and the iMessage relay/proxy. This runbook is repo-local
deployment preparation only. It does not authorize live DNS, MX, port-25,
external-provider, production-cluster, or Argo sync changes.

## Public MX gate

Public MX remains blocked until `ADR-0019`
(`docs/decisions/ADR-0019-standalone-mailbox-server-build-vs-adopt.md`) and
`docs/specs/standalone-corporate-mailbox-server.md` production gates pass. Do
not expose port 25 or publish MX records until all of these are verified:

- DNS readiness: MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MTA-STS, and TLS-RPT.
- TLS issuance and rotation.
- Durable queueing, retry, dead-letter, and bounce behavior.
- abuse controls: no-open-relay negative tests, rate limits, oversized message
  rejection, invalid recipient handling, quarantine or spam path, and audit.
- Observability: redacted logs, delivery metrics, queue depth, alerts, and trace
  correlation.
- Backup, restore, object retention, and rollback procedure.
- Argo rollout health and rollback validation for the non-OCI Talos target.

Until those gates pass, the only acceptable mail work here is internal-only
deployment preparation, disabled-by-default manifests, dry-run checks, and local
or cluster-private smoke tests.

The opt-in relay component also ships with a non-routable TEST-NET bridge egress
CIDR (`192.0.2.0/24`). A non-OCI overlay must patch it to the exact private
macOS bridge CIDR before the component can reach the bridge.

The relay component is stateless by default: it uses a static recipient allowlist
from `imessage-relay-secrets` and does not mount the app runtime database secret.
A future platform-recipient database source must introduce a dedicated
least-privilege relay database role and policies rather than reusing `mnt-db-rt`.
The non-OCI overlay must also patch the TEST-NET caller ingress CIDR, pin the
relay image to a signed immutable digest, and verify a policy-capable CNI before
relying on Kubernetes NetworkPolicy enforcement.

## iMessage relay model

iMessage does not run natively on Talos or Linux. The non-OCI Talos cluster may
host only the relay/proxy workload. A macOS host must run the Messages bridge and
must be reachable by the relay only through a private authenticated channel:

- mTLS, VPN, or another private endpoint.
- Bearer token or stronger application authentication.
- HTTPS-only bridge URL in dry-run and runtime configuration.
- No public bridge endpoint.
- No token, certificate, private key, account password, message body, or contact
  content printed in logs or committed to git.
- Runtime tokens mounted from Secret volumes as files, with only file-path
  environment variables exposed to the relay container.

Repository artifacts may reference only secret names and keys. The expected
runtime inputs are non-OCI Talos kubeconfig/talosconfig plus macOS bridge
endpoint and credential material supplied out of band.

## Dry-run blocker

If the non-OCI Talos kubeconfig/talosconfig or macOS bridge endpoint/certificate
or token inputs are absent, the dry-run guard must fail truthfully instead of
pretending the path is deployable:

```text
BLOCKED_PENDING_NON_OCI_TALOS_CREDENTIALS
blocked_missing_non_oci_talos_or_bridge_credentials
```

The process exits with status `2`. That blocker means the repo-local docs, tests,
and manifests can still land, but live deployment cannot proceed.

## Operator checks

Before any future non-OCI Talos apply, confirm these checks from a clean working
tree:

```sh
test -f docs/runbooks/non-oci-talos-mail-imessage-relay.md
grep -F BLOCKED_PENDING_NON_OCI_TALOS_CREDENTIALS docs/runbooks/non-oci-talos-mail-imessage-relay.md
grep -F MNT_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587 docs/runbooks/non-oci-talos-mail-imessage-relay.md
git diff -- deploy/apps/maintenance/base/configmap.yaml
git diff -- deploy/talos/README.md
```

Expected result for the final two commands in this lane: no diff. The OCI
production deployment remains the source of truth for app/web/API and
transactional OCI Email Delivery while non-OCI Talos credentials and bridge
inputs are missing.
