# Deterministic workaround for a reindeer multi-version limitation. The workspace
# pins sqlx 0.9, but crates/platform/jobs depends on sqlx 0.8 (renamed
# apalis-sqlx) because apalis' rc release requires it. reindeer keys the public
# alias on the PACKAGE name, ignoring the first-party `package=` rename, so it
# emits alias(name="sqlx") for BOTH versions and Buck rejects the duplicate. We
# RENAME the 0.8 alias to a public, non-colliding `sqlx-0_8` (the bare `sqlx`
# alias stays 0.9); first-party `jobs` depends on //third-party/rust:sqlx-0_8.
